# Unscented Kalman Filter Project
This is a Sensor Fusion project in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program. I implement an Unscented Kalman Filter in C++, which takes good care of tracking non-linear movements of other vehicles; in this case, a bicycle.

Here are the final RMSE values:
- **px**: 0.00556882
- **py**: 0.00645458
- **vx**: 0.0957792
- **vy**: 0.0879016

## How to run the project
1. All the code files are in the *src* folder.
2. The executable file named `UnscentedKF` is in the Debug folder.
